# Commandcenter
*hmu @gkbytes on twitter if you want to collaborate or suggest features.*

The idea is to look at this at any point in time and  get a snapshot of your life situation and answer two questions.  
1. How are you ?
2. How is everything ?

## How are you ?
	Physically
	Mentally
## How is everything ?
	Your home
		Is everything in its place ?
	Your Finances
		Do you have enough money to manage
			Food
			Medication
			Fees
	Your Groceries supply

Open [commandcenter.py](https://github.com/gklabs/commandcenter/blob/master/commandcenter.py) to take a look at the proposed functionality. The file is right now written to be rough in order to get an idea of what the application is going to look like.
